CNN with TensorBoard Integration for MNIST Classification:

1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and visualize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
The key feature of this project is the integration of TensorBoard, TensorFlow's visualization toolkit. We use Keras Callbacks to log important metrics and model graphs during training, allowing for in-depth analysis and debugging of the model's performance and structure.

2. Prerequisites
Conceptual Knowledge
Basic understanding of Neural Networks.
Familiarity with the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers).
Understanding of the role of callbacks in Keras/TensorFlow.
Software and Libraries
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
You can install the necessary library with pip:
code
Bash
pip install tensorflow

3. Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used "hello world" dataset in computer vision. It consists of:
60,000 training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
10,000 testing images.
Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
The dataset is loaded directly using the tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist module.

4. How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to train the model and visualize the results.
Step 1: Run the Python Training Script
Execute the Python script (cnn_mnist_tensorboard.py) from your terminal. This script will:
Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Build and compile the CNN model.
Train the model for 10 epochs.
Create a timestamped directory inside logs/fit/ to store the training logs for TensorBoard.
code
Bash
python cnn_mnist_tensorboard.py
Step 2: Launch TensorBoard
Once the script has finished training, open a new terminal in the same project directory and run the following command:
code
Bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
This will start the TensorBoard server. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal.
Special Instructions for Google Colab / Jupyter
If you are running this in a notebook environment like Google Colab, you can launch TensorBoard directly within the notebook using a "magic command". Run this in a new cell after the training cell has completed:
code
Python
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir logs/fit

5. Exploring the TensorBoard Dashboard
Once TensorBoard is running, you can explore several tabs:
Scalars: View interactive plots of the loss and accuracy for both the training and validation datasets. This is crucial for identifying issues like overfitting (where training accuracy is high but validation accuracy plateaus or decreases).
Graphs: Explore an interactive graph of your model's architecture. This helps ensure that all layers are connected as expected.
Distributions & Histograms: Visualize how the weights and biases in each layer of your network change over time (epochs). This can be useful for diagnosing problems like vanishing or exploding gradients.

6. Code Explanation
The Python script cnn_mnist_tensorboard.py is structured as follows:
Load and Preprocess Data:
The MNIST dataset is loaded.
Images are reshaped to (28, 28, 1) to include a channel dimension for the CNN.
Pixel values are normalized from the [0, 255] range to [0, 1] for better training performance.
Labels (digits 0-9) are one-hot encoded into vectors of length 10.
Build the CNN Model:
A Sequential Keras model is defined.
The architecture consists of two convolutional blocks (Conv2D followed by MaxPooling2D) to extract features.
A Flatten layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
A Dense (fully-connected) layer with 128 neurons acts as a classifier.
A Dropout layer is included to prevent overfitting.
The final Dense layer has 10 neurons with a softmax activation to output probabilities for each of the 10 digit classes.
Set Up TensorBoard Callback:
A unique log directory is created using the current date and time. This ensures that logs from different training runs are kept separate.
The TensorBoard callback is instantiated, pointing to the log directory. histogram_freq=1 enables the logging of weight distributions for every epoch.
Compile and Train:
The model is compiled with the adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss function.
The model.fit() function is called, and the tensorboard_callback is passed via the callbacks list. This instructs Keras to send logs to TensorBoard at the end of each epoch.
